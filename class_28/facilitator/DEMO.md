# Demos: Django CRUD

The approach for demos during the Django module is simple but has challenges beneath surface.

Ideally, you'll be able to build the project up from scratch each day, with the pace accelerating.

So the "demo" for today is building out the solution in class. If time does not allow for a full rebuild then you can make a copy of the solution code and strip it down to a suitable starting point.

An alternate approach to speed things up is to selectively paste in completed sections vs. typing them all out.
